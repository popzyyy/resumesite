# Bit Maze

## WARNING

Before you access the game, make sure that you're in the environment where playing music/sound is allowed.

## Description

This is the first game I created using [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).

I usually create this game when I'm trying to use a game engine that's not familiar to me.

I just made a little re-design to the images, because why not.

This is also my first time using Python. It's fun to code with.

The source code of this is game is in my repository.

## Game description

This game is simple. Just control the character using your left/arrow key then space bar to jump.

Try to react the goal to complete the game. The finish line is the dancing mysterious plant.

Avoid the spiders that are hidden around the map. If you made contact to it, you lose.

## Resources

All the assets (images/audios) are created using this game engine.
